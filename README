📄 README – GitLab Software Assurance Integration Plan (Neutral Draft)

1. Purpose

This document outlines a simple plan to migrate the existing software assurance workflow from SharePoint to GitLab.
The goal is to centralize code, automate security checks, and generate reliable assurance artifacts, all within a Zero Trust access model.

⸻

2. Objectives
	1.	Centralize all development code in a single GitLab environment.
	2.	Automate security scanning and policy enforcement.
	3.	Apply Zero Trust principles to access control.
	4.	Produce clear, repeatable assurance reports.
	5.	Replace manual SharePoint-driven tasks with GitLab-native workflows.

⸻

3. Scope (Initial Phase)
	•	Included: Development software repositories and their associated assurance workflows.
	•	Artifacts: Source code, pipelines, scan results, and security reports.
	•	Excluded for now: Non-development repositories, deployment systems, legacy SharePoint document trails.

The scope is intentionally narrow for a clean pilot rollout.

⸻

4. High-Level Architecture

GitLab serves as a combined:
	•	Source repository
	•	Version control system
	•	CI/CD automation engine
	•	Security scanning hub
	•	Evidence repository

All activity is traceable and attributable to a user.

⸻

5. Zero Trust Considerations

Zero Trust in this plan means:
	•	No user or system is trusted by default.
	•	Access is explicitly granted based on role.
	•	Pipelines enforce mandatory checks before code can advance.
	•	Every action is logged and reviewable.

⸻

6. Automated Security Controls

Security scans that will be incorporated into GitLab pipelines:

Initial Set
	•	SAST: Detects insecure code patterns.
	•	Dependency Scanning: Identifies vulnerable libraries.
	•	Secret Detection: Prevents accidental credential commits.

Expandable Set (Future)
	•	DAST
	•	Container Scanning
	•	License Compliance

Assurance Evidence

Pipelines generate:
	•	Vulnerability reports
	•	SBOMs
	•	Merge request security summaries
	•	Pipeline audit logs

These provide a consistent assurance trail.

⸻

7. Workflow Summary
	1.	Developer commits code or opens a merge request.
	2.	GitLab automatically runs all configured security checks.
	3.	Merge requests cannot proceed until required scans pass.
	4.	GitLab stores all reports and logs in the pipeline history.
	5.	Reviewers or assurance personnel can view or export evidence at any time.

⸻

8. Access Control Model

Roles are defined with least-privilege principles:
	•	Developer: Commit code, submit merge requests.
	•	Maintainer: Approve merges, adjust pipelines as needed.
	•	Reviewer/Security: Read-only access to assurance outputs.
	•	Administrator: Platform configuration only.

Zero Trust means no role implicitly inherits additional privileges.

9. Migration from SharePoint

SharePoint Activity	GitLab Replacement
Manual file uploads	Structured commits to version control
Manual change logs	Automated Git history
Manually reviewing vulnerabilities	Automated scans on each commit
Manually uploading documentation	Automatically generated pipeline artifacts
Manual approval routing	Merge request review rules

The GitLab workflow replaces manual, document-driven processes with automated, repeatable checks.

⸻

10. Initial Deliverables
	•	Defined list of repositories entering GitLab assurance
	•	Base pipeline template with required scans
	•	Role and permission framework
	•	Sample security reports
	•	Documented workflow and expectations

⸻

11. Next Steps
	1.	Finalize repository list and ownership.
	2.	Build a prototype repository using the new workflow.
	3.	Configure baseline SAST and dependency scanning.
	4.	Validate reports and adjust gates.
	5.	Expand pipelines as needed.
	6.	Onboard development teams to the new workflow.

⸻

12. Current Status

Planning stage.
No configurations implemented yet.
Next milestone: Establish repository structure and roles.

If you want, I can prepare:
	•	A 1-page briefing version
	•	A diagram-only version
	•	A template pipeline (.gitlab-ci.yml)
	•	A Zero Trust justification memo
	•	A glossary for non-technical stakeholders

Just tell me which one you want.
