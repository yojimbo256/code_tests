3. Recommendations
1. Patch & Upgrade
Immediately update to the latest LTS release (11.0.22+ or current patch) to mitigate active CVEs

Retire unpatched legacy JREs and consolidate multiple versions when possible

2. Lock Down Runtime Environment
Restrict Java network access via firewalls unless explicitly required by the application

Use Java Security Manager and restrict file system and network permissions via policy files

Disable or remove unused components (e.g., JavaFX, RMI if not needed)

3. Supply Chain & Code Integrity
Verify source origin for JAR files and digitally sign all custom Java applications

Use SBOM tools (e.g., CycloneDX, OWASP Dependency-Check) to track third-party libraries and dependencies

4. Monitoring & Detection
Enable verbose logging and audit trails for Java applications that access sensitive data

Use endpoint protection tools to monitor Java process behavior and block abnormal execution

Incorporate Java-specific rules into SIEM (e.g., JNDI injection, classloader abuse)
