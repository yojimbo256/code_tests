Got you ‚Äî here‚Äôs a clean update you can log under your GitLab issue for **‚ÄúManage Group Security Policies with Terraform‚Äù** to reflect the current status and work completed:

### ‚úÖ **Status Update ‚Äì Implementation Completed**
**Engineer:** Keith Alexander  
**Date:** April 21, 2025

#### üîß **What Was Done**
- Created Terraform configurations to enforce standardized group security controls using the `gitlabhq/gitlab` provider.
- Defined a GitLab branch protection policy:
  - Restricted `main` branch pushes to developers and above.
  - Required CODEOWNERS approval for merges.
- Automatically uploaded a `.gitlab/CODEOWNERS` file to the repository via Terraform.
- Connected to the GitLab API using a Personal Access Token with appropriate scopes (`api`, `read_api`, `write_repository`, etc.).
- Parameterized sensitive inputs (`gitlab_token`, `project_id`) via a `terraform.tfvars` file.
- Resolved provider version mismatch and dependency lock errors by running `terraform init -upgrade`.
- Validated and applied changes successfully with `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`.
- Verified clean state: all Terraform resources were created as expected and an obsolete null resource was removed.

#### üìÅ **Artifacts and Files Created**
- `codeowners.tf`: Enforces CODEOWNERS policy.
- `sast-policy.yml`: Defines a scan execution policy for SAST.
- `terraform.tfvars`: Stores sensitive values.
- `.gitlab/CODEOWNERS`: Uploaded via Terraform.
- `safety.tf`: No longer needed; deprecated and removed.

#### üß™ **Testing/Validation**
- Confirmed policy and CODEOWNERS file appeared in GitLab repository UI.
- Verified branch protection and merge rules were active under GitLab settings.
- No errors during `terraform apply`; state synced successfully.

Let me know if you want a shorter version for a scrum update or something even more technical for documentation.
